# Plasmid
Plasmid is a work-in-progress server-side minigames library based on Fabric.

This is currently being developed alongside [Bed Wars](https://github.com/gegy1000/bed-wars) as well as [Spleef](https://github.com/gegy1000/spleef). 

This is apart of an attempt to create an open source Fabric-based minigames server!
